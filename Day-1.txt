What is DS?
   Data Structure are different ways of organizing data on your computer, 
that can be used effectively,

Example:

Movie Tickets - Queue
Books on Table - Stack

What is Algorithms?
	Set of instruction/steps to perform/complete a task

Example:

Going to office
Buying Coffee in Starbucks

Types of Data Structure

*Primitive(DS that are built in the programming language itself) - Integer, Float, Charcter, Boolean
*Non Primitive(User defined DS) - Divide into two
	+Linear -  items are arranged in memory in linear, sequential manner and they can be either static or  dynamic
		*Static - Array
		*Dynamic - LL, Stack, Queue
	+Non Linear - Data is connected to several other items, they are not organized sequentially - Tree, Graph

Types of Algorithms

*Simple recursive Algorithms
*Divide and conquer 
*Dynamic Programming
*Greedy
*Brute Force
*Ramdomized

Recursion - a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself
	+Properties-
	*Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
	*In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
	*Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur

When to choose recursion?
*Design an algorithm to compute nth...
*Write code to list the n...
*Implement a method to compute all..

Writing Recursion in 3 steps
*1- Recursive case - the flow
*2- Base case - the stopping criterion
*3- Unintentional case - the constraint
